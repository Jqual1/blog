# Look at some of the games that I have helped to create or have helped polish up! #
I have worked on many games in my classes so far, and a good chunk of them are not currently available to the public, but the ones that are can be found on my itch.io page.
Check out my [itch.io](https://jqual1.itch.io/)!
Then there is also a fun game that I made in Java called Ono. It is very similar to Uno, but bugs are features and you don't choose the color that it changes to. [Here](https://github.com/Jqual1/Ono) is the code for that.
