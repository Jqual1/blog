#### Setting up a Jekyll Blog Before the Rest of the Class Wasn't Easy
When making this blog it was *extremely* confusing. I've worked in the [Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840) before, but nevertheless, my errors confused me.
Here are some of the things that confused me.

* `Gemfile` should **NOT** be a *.txt* file
* Sometimes you just have to run a command again if you have errors
* Changing parts of the theme sounds more confusing than it actually is

Basically everything was new to me at the time of creating this blog, but now everything makes a lot more sense.
I am looking forward to doing more with Jekyll blogs and formatting this one into a much more nice looking product.
I will definitely be looking into [Jekyll themes](https://www.wowthemes.net/jekyll-themes-templates/) to use for this website and then edit them to be exactly how i want them.
