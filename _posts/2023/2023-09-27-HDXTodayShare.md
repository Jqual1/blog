These past two weeks have been exciting! This past weekend was Family Weekend here at Hendrix,
so we had a concert for choir, orchestra, and wind ensemble! I ended up getting pulled into
the percussion section of wind ensemble the week before last, so I was in both the choir and wind ensemble!


## Hendrix Today App

In the past two weeks I have done a lot of digging into the Hendrix Today App.
A lot of this is just getting familiar with it and figuring out how to make relatively simple changes.
The actually issues I have fixed are the inconsistent event visibility across pages and fixing the share formatting.

## What's Coming Up?

- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog. (one day)
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Family Weekend Concert
- Fixed Inconsistent Event Visibility in HDXtoday
- Fixed Share Formatting in HDXtoday
