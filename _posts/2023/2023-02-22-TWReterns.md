This past week wasn't incredibly productive, but I did work on getting caught up everywhere I could.
First of all, it was a 3 day weekend! Sadly though, I had plans all weekend, so I was busy.

## Tempest Winds

This week we started back up work on Tempest Winds!
It feels really good to stop working on Cultivating Competencies, and I hope that we can make quick work of this game.
In our meeting last week, Ian and I worked on developing the story and a plan for Tempest Winds, and it went incredibly well.
We were able to sketch out an outline to the game and write down a lot of things that needed to be done.
Another thing that happened during that meeting was us going through the art database and picking out which pieces would be best suited for this game.
This took a long time, but we decided on them by the end of the meeting.

I was assigned with a few things for this project. I needed to think of attributes for two characters and complete 2 types of games.
Progress was made in all fronts. I set aside time for brainstorming about these characters and even started on the jigsaw puzzles.
After watching the videos of how to do it, I went back into our game and got to work.
However, I quickly thought of a quicker way, copying our current puzzle and modifying it.
I inspected our puzzle, copied it, got rid of the overlaying picture, and then noticed how misaligned it was.
So I went through and aligned each piece on the copy.
Then, I realized I should also do this for the original... You see the problem?
I could've saved a lot of effort if I would've done the original originally. However, I instead did the copy first.
Good new though, both are now aligned and now I just need to duplicate the copy, figure out which picture to use, and make the puzzle the size of the picture so that I can put the picture on the puzzle.

## Hendrix Today App

This past week I had one other goal, get the **Hendrix Today App** on my computer and working.
Initially I was going through a tremendous amount of trouble because I couldn't get the app to launch.
It kept saying there was an error with skipping the connection to Firebase or something similar.
After like an hour though, I finally figured out that this was all because of the IOS emulator.
The thing is, I need to do something special to test this on an emulated iPhone, so I instead just tried it on Android and it instantly worked.

I spent some time going through the app, inspecting it, and trying to decipher how it all worked.
The important thing is that it is now working on my system.

## Acxiom

The website is continuing to progress! I've been getting more bugs out of the way and have been working hard to deliver the requested features.
I am taking into account everything that my team needs for this website to be easy for them to use, as well as putting in ways to determine who makes changes to these tables. There are some things that I will need my team to help me on to automate the filling in of two new columns upon insertion, but besides that, I have been able to do quite a bit myself.
Additionally, last week I had a meeting with my manager, and he is happy to hear that I have been enjoying this project.
He has also been impressed and has brought up the possibility of me training some of my team in Website Development.
We talked for quite a while about various other things about my work, including about if I think that I will need more projects, and then ended our meeting.
Overall, I am excited to see what the future has in store here. I want to continue working on projects and think that I may become a Full Stack Developer.
