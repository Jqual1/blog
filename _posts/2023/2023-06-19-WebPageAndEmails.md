## Acxiom

This past week has been much more focus on emails and such as I've been taking a break from the website.
Some of my coworkers and I were all put on this so that we could cover as people went on vacation and as large influxes
of emails that needed to be checked came in. There have been meetings twice per day to make sure everything stays on schedule,
and we have been making sure that we are all on the same page and looking at the right things.

Additionally, I found out in my Thursday meeting that the first page I made in the internal website will not go unused!
It turns out that not all of that line of business was canceled by our client, so it still has limited use for auditing a couple times per month.
This is great news! I am going to start working with one of my coworkers on more file-tracking solutions we can implement into the website this week as well.
With my team, we are slowly mainstreaming the way that people are doing common tasks via the website.
They create the initial plans, and then I go through the development process with a lot of back and forth.

Today is a company holiday, so there was no work, but I am hoping that we can get a lot done this week.
I know there is a lot of email scrutinizing that may need to be done, but I am hoping I can get back to work on some website issues.
Also, I am going to try and block out my time so that I have goals for each section of time. This should help with documentation a ton.

## What's Coming Up?

- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Been working on checking emails
- My first webpage on the website will still be used!
- Looking to work on file tracking this week
- Looking to block out my time better this week
