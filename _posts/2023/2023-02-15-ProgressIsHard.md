Another week down, and it has been quite a productive one!
I have been enjoying work immensely, and I have been taking needed time to myself.
This has given me more time to play games and hang out with my friends, and that makes me happier.
Some issues are still persisting, but we will see what can be done this week!
We are going to keep this blog post kind of short this week though because we have struggled with Cultivating Competencies progress.

## Cultivating Competencies

Analytics? Bad. We are still getting the **`ValueError: SSL support not available`** error.
I have been doing a lot of research into this issue, but I have not been able to find a solution as of yet.
I think I am just going to need a break from this project for a while and come back later to make progress or see a fix.
This week I think that I will contact the makers of Ren'Py to see what we need to do to resolve this issue.
Good news though! We were able to find where to see where the data and individuals are connected!
This means that we can see an individual's choices and turn that data into something more useful to us.
I also deleted all of our test data, so we now have much less users to worry about.
I will probably let that data build back up until we near a new big stage for these analytics.

## Acxiom

Another great week at Acxiom!! I have gotten the whole section of website I wanted to get done completed,
I have squashed some bugs, and I even did a live demo of this section of the website!
My team and I are working closely together so that they can tell me what all they need,
and I can fulfill those needs. It amazes me the speed that I have been able to develop this website.
This has taught me so much, and during a meeting yesterday, this learning allowed me to help identify and resolve an issue.
In a small part of the code, one word was incorrect which caused a lot of things later on to not work,
so we combed through the code that the end result was relying on and found the one word that somehow got changed.
We believe that there were two versions of this code, one with the correct var name and one with the incorrect one.
The source code I received must've been the slightly outdated one, and the only change was this word.

## What's Coming Up?

- Figure out the SSL support not available bug.
- Add more analytics data.
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- I have not found anything new about analytics.
  - Nothing seems to be working on the website version.
  - I will probably email them this week and see if anything can be done.
- The internal website at Acxiom has been quickly progressing.
  - My team has been pleasantly surprized and impressed.
- I am working more closely with my team now.
