These past couple of weeks we have done a lot of work on the game, I have been working hard at Acxiom, and I have been getting caught up on my homework.

## Tempest Winds

We've been working hard to get this game completed. This means that a lot of things were completed or fixed.

The main thing we did was make a lot of progress on integrating the script into the game itself.
Previously we just had our own notes, but now we have almost everything in the game.
Another thing that I did was create the intro scene. It is only a dark gray screen with dialogue, but it should work sufficiently since the player was supposedly about to fall asleep.
Of course, with this I've done a lot of bug fixes regarding the dialogue box and the intro scene.
Additionally, I changed every default Unity element that I saw to be something different.

One bug that I am currently running into is that the intro dialogue for the new locations after hitting the Next Level button are not playing. I am trying to delve deeper into why this is happening and will hopefully figure it out today.

## Acxiom

At Acxiom, I have been working hard to make sure I deliver on what my team expects from me.
There have been a lot of things that get brought up in meetings and I make sure to keep it all in mind when I choose my next priority.
Most of this, luckily, involves stuff surrounding the internal website. I enjoy working on it and proposing solutions using it!

## What's Coming Up?

- Finish my assigned tasks for **Tempest Winds**
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Fixed a lot of Tempest Winds Bugs
- Got the UI looking better
- Added in most of the script
- Added in the intro scene
- Ran into another bug about the next level intro dialogue not popping up
