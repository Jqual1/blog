## Acxiom

These past two weeks haven't been bad at all, but they have been a lot slower. 
I haven't had as much work assigned to me, and it's just not a busy time of year for us.
One of the main projects that I have been working on is the internal website,
however, I have recently been informed that one of our lines of business that used it is dissolving.
Therefore, that section of the website that I spent a plethora hours on will probably no longer be used.
That is, the part that was used for billing for that line of business.
This is a bit of a bummer, but I learned a ton from this section of the project.

Some of the things I accomplished:
- Created 4 tables to view various auditing information
  - 2 of tables have sections that can be edited by the user
    - Like Notes and other field
  - 1 of the tables has an editable version that allows admins to see different fields and, naturally, edit those fields.
- Made all of the tables are scrollable with sticky headers and able to be minimized.

Ever since this project has been canceled I have been working on a dashboard for people keeping track of the inbound files.
I am also being put back on helping with emails and looking for more projects to start or assist with.

## What's Coming Up?

- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- A line of business is being dissolved
  - With this, one of the projects I have worked on may also become unused
- I am now looking for more projects and helping the associates that could use it
