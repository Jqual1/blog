This was a stressful week for me, so I didn't get much done on the games at all.
In our meeting last Wednesday I worked with Ian to have everything that he did work together nicely and to bugfix.
Afterwards, the only thing I did was start to work on Climate Goes Political's camera if I remember right.

This weekend my car wouldn't start and the cause was a corroded battery.
There are many other problems with my car that made the process of changing the battery take an entire day.
On top of that, I am having trouble trying to get my schedule at Walmart back to normal after getting COVID two weeks ago.
Everything is stressful, but that should change a little bit once I get back into the groove of things.

This month has taught me that things can go wrong, but, as long as you have the right people in your life to support you,
things will get better and you will get through it.
