Last week was the start of many things. We contacted all of our Game Dev partners
to set up meetings for this next week, and we had a meeting with the
Web Dev partners to help them finalize their ideas to give CSCI340.
I personally made a spreadsheet for the Disco Tray Studio logins,
cleaned up the new itch.io profile, and spent time helping Ian figure
out a schedule to meet with the Game Dev partners.

This week I will be participating in the following meetings:

* Dr. Scott - Wednesday 9:00 - Everyone
* Tricia Burris and Leigh Lassiter-Counts - Thursday 12:00 - Everyone
* Dr. Chomphosy - Thursday 2:00 - Jonathon
* Dr. Veselka-Bush - Friday 9:00 - Everyone

To prepare for the meetings and the future discussions with my team this week
I will work on playing through the different games and taking notes on them.
