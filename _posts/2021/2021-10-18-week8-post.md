This week we finished up Astronomical Bodies. It is now up on [itch.io](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/).
I worked on fixing bugs, and then worked on putting the game up on itch.io.
I spent a lot of time formatting the page to make sure it all looked good.
I kept the Disco Tray Studios colors on the page.

After all was done, I got started on ChemSim a little bit.
In ChemSim, I focused on testing new ways to reformat the text, and putting in the Disco Tray Studios splash logo on it.
Afterwards, I enjoyed my fall break.
