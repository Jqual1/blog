This week I focused on ChemSim at first. After Ian was done with the initial creation of the tables, I worked on the updated UI that would accompany it.
I added a new button to show and hide the drag and drop table, as well as changing all of the text to the new font.
The new font made everything a lot more legible, and I feel like we will be done with this game quickly if we continue to make progress at this rate.
After I finished up the UI, I edited the information of ChemSim, @itsmaya, and Climate Goes Political to implement Disco Tray Studios as the company with the DiscoTray splash screen in each of these games. I also fixed Climate Goes Political to have the right screen size. It was a very easy change. This means that both ChemSim and Climate Goes Political are almost ready to be released.
