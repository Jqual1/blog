Ian and I have been putting in a lot of effort to polish up Astronomical Bodies this past week. I made it to where the textboxes show the number for each body and to where these textboxes were editable when the game is paused. I also added options to edit the name of the planets and to edit the color of the planets. Lastly, I implemented a selection system that can calculate distance. The selection system only allows you to select two planets, and lets you calculate the distance between them. This distance is currently unlabeled, but a number is being shown. Ian made the new gravity work, and this caused the game to run a lot better.

Also, whenever I had free time, I read the materials that Dr. Veselka-Bush sent for @itsmaya.

This week I plan to meet up with Ian to work with him to polish up the game. After this is done, I will focus on @itsmaya a lot more.
