Over the past two weeks I have been working on @itmaya more casually as my attention moves to the end of my classes.
However, I have still done a lot of work on it.
First, there were two bugs that were not allowing me to continue the game.
Both were caused IndexOutOfBounds Errors in the same place, so it was difficult to figure out how to fix them.
After I while of combing through the code I figured our the two places where we were going out of bounds.
Afterwards, I worked on our new capital system.
I rearranged the capital screen and made it to where it shows an estimate of how much each policy will affect each relationship using arrow.

As you can see, everything is now in position so that the capital screen is always visible. This is visible all throughout the game now.
I have also worked our some temporary values for the policies and decisions.
They will all need to be reviewed so that we can have a more interesting game,
and we will have to work out if we want to make minimum values for each policy and decision in the game.

This next week, I will be reviewing everything that I have done and looking to implement these min values.
