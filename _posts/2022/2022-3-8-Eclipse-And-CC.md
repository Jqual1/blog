Last week I didn't make a post, so this week's post will include all the things that I have done in these past two weeks.
It has been a pretty productive two weeks, and I have enjoyed working on both the Solar Eclipse website and Cultivating Competencies.
There has been some struggle as far as time management goes, but I have been working hard to manage my time and prioritize these tasks.

## Cultivating Compitencies

In Cultivating Compitencies, I have focused on trying to make the background less pixilated and more game-like.
After a few different tries, I finally found a way to make backgrounds that fit the game well while still being Hendrix.
I tried tracing the background myself and then, after that was taking too much time, I tried finding filters online.
The website that I ended up using to transform the pictures is [Lunapic](https://www4.lunapic.com/editor/).
This turned the backgrounds from pixelated and realistic to more smoothed out and geometric patterns as shown below.

## Solar Eclipse Website

I have done a lot of hard work on recreating the solar eclipse website using my Jekyll theme.
Connor was already working on this website, but was having trouble with the theme he was using,
so I transfered it over to use the theme I use on here and completely customized it to be similar to the final project I helped create.
The hardest part was finding the classes to customize each of the different parts of the website,
such as the background to the dropdown menu of the navbar.
At this point I am trying to think of ways to make the website easier for Dr. Wright to use.
Some things I was thinking of doing are making a cheat sheet or making an example post that works similar to a cheat sheet.

## Blog

This week I did a little more work on my blog as well.
I added more icons to the bottom of the page, made them bigger, and changed the main color to blue.
I have also been working a little more on the new pages that I have wanted to create.

## What's Next?

- Set up a meeting with Tricia Burris and Leigh Lassiter-Counts for the Cultivating Competencies demo
- Set up a meeting with Dr. Wright for the Solar Eclipse website.
- Create a better landing page for this blog
- Separate posts page to be a separate page
- Create a logo for my blog
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio

## TL;DR

- I customized the backgrounds in Cultivating Competencies
- I recreated the Solar Eclipse website using Jekyll
- I customized my blog a little more
  - New Icons at the bottom
  - Bigger Icons
  - New blue primary color
