The last two weeks were rough as the semester is coming to an end
and I am waiting on a response from Acxiom for an internship.
They said they were gonna try to get back to me today,
but they must've ran out of time and will get back to me tomorrow.
If I get the internship I will definitely post about it.

## Cultivating Competencies

I spent some time working on Cultivating Competencies.
The story is slowly coming together,
and we figured out a new naming system for the files
to make reading the decision tree easier for all of us.
I now have a club fair scene sketched out and a party/homework scene started.
There are also some mechanics that I outlined in the Obsidian files.

## Eclipse

The guide to setup the Eclipse Website to run locally on your computer was created for Dr. Wright!
It took a while, but the fact that I reset my computer made it easier.
This also means that I put the Eclipse website in a DTS repo.
As far as Disco Tray Studios is concerned,
this project is out of our hands unless she asks for further assistance.

## What's Coming Up?

- Finish making the Climate Goes Political map cohesive.
  - Make the whole world change depending on different pollution levels.
  - Have the npc be able to be destroyed by business as usual.
  - Make the cities look even more different on every city level.
- Help Ian with Cultivating Competencies as needed.
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Create a logo for my blog (Might be done? Unsure)
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Made a Guide for Dr. Wright for the Eclipse website.
- Put the Eclipse website in a Disco Tray Studios repo.
- Cultivating Competencies:
  - Created a new naming scheme for readability. (Y1.S1.C1_Title)
  - Sketched the Club Fair Scene
  - Started sketches of the Homework/Party Scene.
