I have had a relaxed week so far. I needed time to myself to reset, but now that I have, I am feeling much better and ready to work.
From this last Monday until the Sunday after spring break I don't have work at Walmart Neighborhood Market too so I will will have a lot of time to relax.
I am fully excited to work on Disco Tray Studios projects this coming week with my newfound focus.

## Solar Eclipse Website

This past week I have focused on making the website more reactive in places where it previously wasn't, like with the logo on the home page.
I did this by changing the pixel measurements to percentages instead.
I tried to make the google forms reactive as well, but I currently can't find a simple way to do that.
Afterwards, I sent an email to Dr. Wright to schedule a meeting with her to demo the new website.
We have determined the meeting to be on Wednesday at 2.
Lastly, I created a cheat sheet for Dr. Wright to use as reference for markdown and this theme when creating posts.
Hopefully this helps her, but I will be sure to discover any other of her needs in the meeting tomorrow.

## What's Coming Up?

- Create a better landing page for this blog
- Create a logo for my blog
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio

## TL;DR

- I took a mental reset
- I made some parts of the Eclipse Website more reactive
- I created a cheat sheet for making posts on the the Eclipse Website
- I set up a meeting with Dr. Wright, Wednesday @2
