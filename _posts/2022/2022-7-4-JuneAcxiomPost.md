Happy Fourth! Tomorrow is my birthday!
These last few weeks have been very busy as I have been traveling between Clarksville and Conway a lot and then also I have started my first projects, so I haven't had time to post.
One of the reasons I traveled back and forth between Clarksville and Conway was to celebrate Father's Day and the other was to move a bed and a couch up here!
It is very nice to have something besides a futon to sleep on, and my living room looks much more homey now.

## Acxiom Internship

The week of the 13th, I got my first project! It was a simple project, but nonetheless, it was one assigned to me.
What I had to do was go through a list of systems and add myself to all 60 of them while removing Andrew Eveld.
However, I ran into a few issues AFTER submitting them and getting them all approved.
It turned out that we no longer had to remove old employees because they were inactive and thus already removed.
Then there was also the issue that names were put in a place where the system didn't like it, so they had to be found by search rather than username.
These tickets were supposed to be automatic, but I caused that to not work with these errors, and my team also didn't know these would be issues so I had to relay any info to them.
Originally, I didn't know what the error messages meant, but then I got contacted by the team who were getting slammed with working through these tickets manually.
They thought I had automated the process of submitting tickets because I submitted 60 tickets in around an hour, but I didn't.
I ended up duplicating the same tab every time I wanted to create a new ticket so that all the information would be automatically populated and all I had to change was the system id.
They were impressed, but still told me the issues that were going on and asked me to go through and fix the rest of them so that the automation could do it's work and my requests would stop clogging up the system.
So I spent my Thursday and Friday making sure that all the requests went through smoothly.

Then on the week of the 20th we only had a 4-day week cause of Juneteenth and Father's Day!
This week was full of working with my supervisor to automate something that she does every week.
First, we had to go through the steps of what needed to happen and then focused on automating as much as step one as we could.
When that was all said and done, we had it automated and it was left to me to try and automate step two. in my next week.

On the week of the 27th I worked hard to automate step two of this process, but I ended up running into a bug that I never figured out the solution to.
I asked my coworkers to help, but they also had trouble. However, I did get most of step two done and just have to run this section of it manually until this bug is fixed.
Besides that, the interns had a movie night and it was a lot of fun!

So overall, I have been working on a few projects, planning on how to tackle some and successfully tackling others.
My supervisor is impressed by what all I've done and how quickly I learn, and I enjoy working here.
