This week I've felt really tired. I am not quite sure of the source of this, but I am doing what I can to get past this.
Everything feels like a lot, but I finally got in some office hours with three of my professors.
We are getting close to the end of the semester though!

We had our D&D One-Shot event today and it was a pretty good turnout!
People had fun all around and I'm glad that we were able to do this for people.

## Project TempestWinds

We continued work on the Windgate Museum game this week and started to make some progress.
The game is now more planned out with feedback from our client, and we started making the levels.
The basis of this game is a game that can be played on iPads where you solve puzzles involving art.
Players have a few different games that they will be able to play, and at the end there will be a "boss" level.
We are not fully sure how this level will play out, but I think it will go well leading up to this.
One of the levels I am working on is a sliding puzzle game.
Initially, I was following a youtube video on how to do it, but after a while it wasn't working as I wanted it to,
so I went and looked on the unity market to find a template for this kind of game.
I did end up finding such a template that works, but I am now currently getting a bug where the image won't show up on the tiles.
I'm unsure if this is a shader bug or a texture bug. I will continue to look into this.

## Acxiom

This week at Acxiom I was Daytime support. This was a bit tiring.
It wasn't hard though, it just took a lot of my attention.

## What's Coming Up?

- Finish up the different puzzles in Unity
- Show our client where we are
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- I've been a pretty tired lately
- We had a D&D One-Shot event
- We started making progress on the Windgate Museum game (Project TempestWinds)
- I found a really nice implementation of a sliding puzzle game, but there is a texturing error
