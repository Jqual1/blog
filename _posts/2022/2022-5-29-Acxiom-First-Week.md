This past week was exciting but also tiring. I started my internship at Acxiom, but I also moved into summer housing.
Summer housing was a lot of effort to move into and to set everything set up, but it all went smoothly and I am happy to be out of a dorm!

## Acxiom Internship

Now, more importantly, I started my internship at Acxiom this past week.
On Monday all of the new interns went through Orientation; it was a ton of fun meeting all of these new people!
We got set up with our work laptops, and everyone got put in the system.
Additionally, we met our managers and went on a tour of the campus.
Then, for Tuesday and Wednesday I worked on completing as much of my general Acxiom training as I could.
I went into the office every day I worked, because I really like how the campus feels, the free drinks, and the cheap food.
On Tuesday I was a little confused on where my cubical was, but I asked around for help and people got me to the right place.
Then, later that day, my manager and the rest of my team that were in person all went out to eat at Holly's.
Eating there reminded me of my dad's cooking, so it was really good. Andy Cook, my manager, even paid for my meal!
It has been nice getting to know my team and working with it being encouraged to take breaks for mental and physical health.

However, not everything has been good.
There were a lot of issues with getting me added to everything I would need for work with my team.
We had to send in numerous IT requests to get everything working correctly, but by the time I left on Friday, everything was working.
Now, I do have to not that I needed to take Thursday off because of moving day and Friday was only a half day because of Memorial day weekend.
I am happy that I get paid for both the other half of this half day and half of Memorial day, which we have off as well, as an intern though.

Next week, I will be working on training with my team and figuring out exactly what I will be working on.
Of course, not all information about this internship will be able to be disclosed on this blog due to confidentiality, but I will share what I can.
This may mean that everything is generalized.
