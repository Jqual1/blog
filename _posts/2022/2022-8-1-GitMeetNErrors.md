This past week was full of a lot of research as I prepared to be in a meeting for starting back off the Git project.
Some of my time was spent on working on a test version for the website project.
Also disaster strikes as I run into an error that I was not getting previously on my automation!

## Git Meeting

The Git meeting was very insightful. We worked together to create steps for what we need to do in order to start using Git for sharing files/version control.
It turns out that one of our hurdles we first need to get through is a firewall block that is stopping us from using Git on the remote server.
There is now a ticket for that open for the issue to be fixed though.
On Wednesday it should be fixed and I should be able to jump into the project as the lead.

## Test Version of Website

I started working on a test version of the website that some people on my team will use once it is complete.
This should eliminate using emails back and forth for a simple process they need to do.

## Automation Error

When running an automation process that I run every week on Thursdays I ran into a big problem.
The rows of data were not being inputted into the final table.
After a lot of time messing around, my supervisor and I found ways to improve the code and then found an issue.
It all came down to a single ` being in slightly the wrong place.

After all this was said and done, it ran smoothly and I am now ready to take on this week.

## What's Coming Up?

- Start Git Project
- Shadow coworkers
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- I worked on a test version of the website project.
- Had the Git meeting
- Discovered a firewall issue and submitted a ticket
- Caught one of my automated processes breaking.
