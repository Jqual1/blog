We work to finish Cultivating Competencies. A ton of progress is made!
Now, we just need people to play it.

## Cultivating Competencies

This past week we worked extremely hard to make sure that this game got wrapped up.
We did extreme playtesting, added in a ton of new assets, polished up story, and squashed a ton of bugs.
I am glad we got so much done, and I am excited to get feedback from students in the coming weeks.

## Acxiom

Another smooth week at Acxiom! Not much new going on this past week.

## What's Coming Up?

- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
