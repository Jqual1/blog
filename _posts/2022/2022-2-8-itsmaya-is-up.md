This week we finished bug-fixing @itsmaya to get it to a good enough place to put it up on its own [itch.io](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/itsmaya) page.
After I got that up I went to updating the Disco Tray Studios website to include all of the game projects that we have uploaded on our itch.io page in Disco Tray Studios projects.

In the week to come I will try to work on researching Ren'py to see if it's a potential option for remaking the Cultivating Competencies game.
In between doing research on Ren'py, I will go on to try to make the Solar Eclipse website in Jekyll.
