This week has been a lot of independent learning about various Acxiom things.

## Acxiom Internship

Sometimes things are slow and that's okay.
I didn't have anything to work on this past week as they are getting ready to train me 1:1,
so I have generally been looking up various topics that will most likely be useful in my work.
In my meetings I have learned a lot though!
The history of the AT&T team is fascinatingly intense.
They have seen massive growth in the past 3 years, so I will be working on solving the "growing pains" that our systems are going through.
This includes automating as much as I can to free up our resources.

This next week I will be really getting started on projects.
It is exciting to see what all I will be working on.

## What's Coming Up?

- Go to a lot of meetings
- Shadow coworkers
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Create a logo for my blog (Might be done? Unsure)
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- A lot of independent learning
- Learned about the account's history
- Learned about what I will be doing
- Prepped to get started on projects
