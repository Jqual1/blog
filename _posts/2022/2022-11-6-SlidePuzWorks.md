Catching up on homework! No longer tired! Feeling productive again!
It is hard to keep being productive when I keep burning out, but I am trying my best to balance everything out.
I take time working on things that I enjoy working on, and I also have been spending time playing games.
This is a well needed mental break, and got myself feeling more ready to work on stuff, which is why I was able to catch up on homework again.
This week I have been working on various projects, cooking, cleaning, and moving around a lot.
I uploaded 4 hours worth of podcast, and have been hyping up myself to work on projects.
Everything is a mindset. I try to make finishing work a game, whether this is thinking about tasks in a different way or by doing a lot of "sprints."
Everything has been difficult, but that makes it even more rewarding to work through it.

## Project TempestWinds

The sliding puzzle is now working!! It was very strange, but all we needed to do was change the shader.
It took a lengthy amount of time to figure this out.
On top of that, I worked to get a section of building in the game, and fixed some merge conflicts.
This game is coming together, and we should be able to have the demo available soon.
I will definitely have more time after tomorrow to work on this.

## Acxiom

We are continuing looking into my automation projects and taking the next steps!
I created documentation for my projects, showed someone everything I do each week, and they said we should be able to put it directly into our automation system fairly easily.
This means I will no longer need to manually run the script!
I will just have to keep an eye on it so that nothing bad happens.
Also, there is a part that I need to work on automating quicker that I will need to run fairly soon.
This might be a task that I have to wait on though.

## What's Coming Up?

- Getting a demo ready for our client
- Show our client where we are
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- I have been working through my tiredness.
- I am no longer as tired now!
- Burnout is hard to avoid this semester, but I'm doing my best
- I have given myself more relaxation time
- The sliding puzzle is working, I started work on the "building"
- Progress towards further automation is underway at Acxiom
