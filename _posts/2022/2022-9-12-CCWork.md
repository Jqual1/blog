A short, but busy week. Work? Busy. Class? Busy. Disco Tray Studios? Busy.

## Disco Tray Studios

This past week we have been working hard to finalize all ideas and continue implementation while also getting Connor implemented into our team.
Not much visible progress, but a lot of behind the scenes progress.
Then, over the weekend, we worked on putting together a tree of main choices that one could make in Cultivating Competencies.

This week will be one of the busiest for us as we are going into full implementation mode to get the next playtest version out to Career Services.

## Acxiom Internship

A very busy week! We checked a lot of emails with our client and everything went smoothly.
My projects are still on hold, but they might be able to continue this week, unsure though.

## What's Coming Up?

- Heavy Cultivating Competencies work.
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Cultivating Competencies
  - Finalized ideas
  - Prepared for Monday Meeting with a visual chart
  - Getting ready for full implementation mode
- Busy week at the internship
  - Projects are still on hold
