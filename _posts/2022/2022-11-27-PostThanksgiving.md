The past few weeks have been pretty good.
We are in the final stretch of the semester and I just had a great Thanksgiving break.
There was a lot of relaxing involved.

## Cultivating Competencies

We had a meeting with Career Services the other week, and they informed us that they want to use the game in Career Term this year!
This means that we need to make a little more progress in polishing up the game, getting analytics working, and making it easier to install and get running before the end of finals (preferably).

## TempestWinds

These last few weeks we have been working to get the game ready for a demo and we did it.
We have a demo version ready to show our client on Wednesday.
We have all of the puzzles working, a menu screen, and a decent looking space for the art to sit.
It also does work on an iPad screen as is the end goal of this project!
One of the hardest things to figure out this week was how to get the puzzle game correctly randomizing,
and it turns out that this was just because the local locations of the parent objects needed to be reset.
We need to slightly realign the pieces still to make them flush, but now it is randomizing as intended.

## What's Coming Up?

- Meeting with our Windgate Museum client
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- Happy late Thanksgiving
- The TempestWinds demo is ready
- We need to work more on Cultivating Competencies for Career Term
