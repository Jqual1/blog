This week was exciting! My manager was in town,
I began work on a project that will affect my entire team,
and I prepared for the "Play Make Learn" Educational Game Dev Conference.
The excitement for this conference is building and will definitely be a great way to start next week.

## Manager back in town

Until around 2:00 on Thursday, my manager was in Conway.
This led to a lot of interactions throughout the workday.
He would check in a couple times a day and would make sure everything was going okay.
With him around this week, it felt extremely nice to be in the office,
and on Thursday he took two other team members and I out to eat at Holly's (we were the only ones on our team there).

## Project Git

On Monday and Tuesday I prepared to start on transferring to using the Git system for version control of our files.
As of Wednesday, we no longer have a firewall issue preventing us from using Git, so I went to work testing the system.
I copied one of our directories over to the Git repo and quickly discovered this would be a harder task than initially thought.
My coworker told me to be careful as some live code was running, so all I did was copy the files over.
This took a while, but it eventually worked.
Then I tried uploaded to Git, which also took a while but was successful.
However, I could not download the files from Git through a pull request.
Why couldn't I do this? There was too much data taking too long.
After further review I found that this was due to the temporary and log files littering this directory.
I undid my mistakes and added a .gitignore file to fix this.
The pull request took seconds!
By the time all this was done, I worked on figuring out the best system for updating files and the best way to switch the current folders out,
and haven't come to a conclusion yet. This will be next week's challenge.

## What's Coming Up?

- Start Git Project
- Shadow coworkers
- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## TL;DR

- My manager was in Conway this week
- I had lunch with him and other associated on our team
- We started Project Git (a project I am in charge of)
- I prepared for the Play Make Learn Conference
