With Cultivating Competencies out of the way, we have now begun work on a game for the Windgate Museum.
We have a lot of ideas and have brought some to our client.
These past few weeks I have started publishing my [D&D podcast](https://anchor.fm/drunkards-n-dimwits)!
It has felt very rewarding to finally be able to do so.
Additionally, I have spent more time with my plants as the darker days and colder nights approach.
I have invested in grow lamps so that I can hopefully keep them growing all year round.
We will just have to see though, this is all just a big experiment.

## Project TempestWinds

This project for the Windgate Museum has began the planning and development stage!
Mostly planning though, as we talk with eachother and our client.
We know that our client wants the game to be played on iPad if possible, and wants to include the art in the game.
Also, there should be underlying lore.
Ian and I have been hard at work figuring out the idea for this game and I have also been brushing up on Unity skills.
It is pretty fun learning new things about Unity as I make tests for this project, such as learning about the landscaping tool!

## Acxiom

Another smooth week at Acxiom! I had a eureka moment and got my website to connect to the database!
I can finally continue on a lot of projects.
Additionally, I fixed an issue with the Git project that was encountered.
Apparently, they are thinking of moving to GitHub soon, and I had to clear the history of the project due to a mistake that caused it to take up a lof of space. 

## What's Coming Up?

- Continue working on a better landing page for this blog.
- Change "Projects" page to be a portfolio.
- Edit all the pages connected to the WIP landing page.

## T;DR

- I published the first couple episodes of my podcast
- New grow lights for my plants
- Project TempestWinds is underway
- I made decent progress on an Acxiom project
- Git project is also fixed
