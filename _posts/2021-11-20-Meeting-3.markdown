Meeting 3 went almost as good as we could hope for!
Dr. Wright was very pleased with the look of the website and the systems that we have in place currently.
So far, my role has continued to be to work on the submissions pages.
I have gotten the Music Submission and Contact Submission pages working, but I am having trouble with the Volunteer Submission page.
I will continue to do research on how to get this working the way that it is in the Moqup.
I will also update our Trello to reflect what needs to be done on a more detailed level.
After I get this done, I will focus on making sure that all 3 of these pages look presentable and help whoever needs help on the team.
My next task might be the login if no one gets to it before I do.
