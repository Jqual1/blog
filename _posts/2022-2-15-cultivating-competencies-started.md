Happy belated Valentine's day!
Last week I got pretty stressed with my classes and work, but I made it through it.
I am trying to think of ways to better relieve stress with my busy schedule.
Hopefully I will be able to relieve the stress soon so that I can absorb information better.

This past week we worked on getting started with Cultivating Competencies.
While looking at ways to visualize our story-telling in I found [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
Obsidian is a great file organization tool where you can organize your thoughts in the form of markdown files.

As we can see, you can link files together and color code then depending on the tags that you add to the end.
This can make it easier to group things together and allow you to visualize the trees or webs of choices.
In this example, I show a lot of things being referenced by outline and an example choice tree.
As you add more things, this visualization of the files updates.
Both Ian and I like the idea of using this as our primary source of charting out the story of the game, so we will continue to talk about the story with each other.
