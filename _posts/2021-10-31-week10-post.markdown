Happy Halloween!!
This has been an eventful week!
**ChemSim:** Added missing sounds to the Volume Mixer, Fixed names, changedbuttons to toggle instead of just show, changed the See All Values text.
**@itsmaya:** Volume Mixer, removed unecessary scenes.
**Climate Goes Political:** Volume Mixer, Fixed Volume Mix, Fixed equation, Fixed animations.
Now we have volume mixers on even more of the games. This was a feature that we wanted to incorperate from Astronomical Bodies to every other game, and so far it is doing well.
And this week I will have a meeting with Dr. Chomphosy to discuss the game.
