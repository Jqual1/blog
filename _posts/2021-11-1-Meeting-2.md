Our second client meeting went well. We got together a Moqup and Dr. Wright liked what we had so far.
She had some small changes that she wanted made as far as positioning of things on the navbar, but besides that all was good.
So far, I have contributed by helping with the design of each page and helping brainstorm how we want each database to be constructed.
I have also finished both labs 7 and 8, so I think I am well prepared to start work on the actual website.
To further contribute to the team, I plan on working on the submission databases to prepare us for meeting 3.
