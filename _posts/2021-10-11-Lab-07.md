When I was working with the Razor Pages I thought that it all seemed pretty simple and straight forward. The tutorial was easy, explained everything well, and put everything in manageable chunks. I don't think anything about it was confusing. However, when I tried to translate the tutorial into my own thing I began to have issues. I wanted to make my Razor Page, [My Video Games](https://github.com/Jqual1/csci340lab7), be able to search three ways instead of two. I struggled for a long time because of an if statement that had the wrong variable in it. Other than that I had no issues.

Jekyll and Razor both have pages, customizable layouts, and more, but they also have different ease of uses and different purposes. With a Jekyll website, you don't really have to do anything past the initial setup. It looks decent, and adding posts is really easy. You don't even need to know anything about coding for Jekyll, but it is a static page.
With Razor there is a possibility for more, but it is more difficult to use. To use it, you have to know at least a little bit of coding, but it allows you to have webpages with a database behind it. A webpage that the user can interact with and change in a meaningful way (ie. updating the database in various ways.)
