This past week we finished up Astronomical Bodies and Climate Goes Political and I put them up on the Disco Tray Studios [itch.io](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/) page.

## ChemSim ##
In order to get ChemSim ready for publishing, we had to reorganize the UI to make it look better and more uniform with the style of this game.
This included changing the style of the buttons, changing the positioning of the buttons, and removing buttons that were no longer needed.
Ian and I worked hard to make this UI intuitive to the user, and tried to leave no room for confusion.
A thing to note is that this game is still in need of development.
We had hoped that we would have had more reactions to put into this game, but we sadly never heard back with a list of reactions, so until then, we must move on to other games.

## Climate Goes Political ##
This week I had my meeting with Dr. Chomphosy to show him Climate Goes Political and get his thoughts on it, as well as see if we could feasibly implement the WebDICE model.
After some discussion, he decided that a task as big as implementing the WebDICE model would require much more compensation than is currently being provided.
With that out of the way, I let him play through the game with the updated equation and even showed him the equations used, and he loved them.
This game is exactly what he wants to use in his class, and he plans to use it on Monday, November 15.
The only things that he wanted was some clarification on when things changed and some of the text fixed that I just hadn't gotten around to fixing yet at the time of the meeting.
I fulfilled his requests the day after the meeting and went on to work on publishing both of the games.
I emailed him that his game was up and asked if Ian and I could sit in the class when they test the game, and he said we are absolutely invited.

## Struggles Publishing the Games ##
As you can see from the images, the games turned out well, but I did have problems trying to get them up.
For ChemSim I had issues with getting some of the reactants to show up, but Ian didn't have that problem,
so I made the page and uploaded an initial version of the game that Ian later replaced with a working one.
For Climate Goes political, I had a different issue. I could not get the game to work on itch for some reason.
I kept trying and then decided to just focus on making the page look the best I could.
After a while I ended up looking through the settings to see that there was a compression method enabled in unity for it.
This was something that we always disable in our Unity games that we publish as HTML5 embedded games on itch.io.
After disabling this I finally got the game uploaded and published the page.

## What's next? ##
For this last month of work, we will be putting all of our focus on @itsmaya.
This will be a definite challenge seeing that it has a lot of systems that need to be thought out again and reworked,
but I have already put in a lot of time thinking of new ways to do things and making new systems in the code.
Hopefully we will be able to make quick progress on this game now that we have a good system on making these games,
but only time will tell.
