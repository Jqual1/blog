After creating a Jekyll blog it is important to know how to customize it and have the blog you want.

What was new? The specific way you had to change things in the blogs, and adding pages and links to the navbar.

What did I struggle with? Adding links to the navbar. It was a simple line of code that I didn't quite understand how to implement at the time.

What parts still do not make sense? Everything makes sense now. It is all coming together and I think that I can continue to edit this website as I please.

What am I looking forward to? Editing this website to look more modern.
