Since the New Year I have been working on finding a new blog theme.
The old one just didn't look good to me and I thought it was time to get something more professional looking.

For reference, here is the old theme:

![Old Blog Theme](/blog/assets/img/blog/blog_1.png)

It took several tries to get a new theme installed because the format of things would change with the change of a theme.
Essentially, I had to first fork the theme, change the config and everything else important,
and then drag all the files into my blog to replace the old ones.
Afterwards, I had to go into each post and change the formatting to match the new theme.
Otherwise, the pages would not format right.

Here is the blog now:

I am now using the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme with the neon skin.
I like this theme a lot more because it feels less bland, more modern, and more personalized.
This blog now feels much more like my blog.
