# Look at some of the Games and Projects that I have helped to create or have helped polish up! #
I have worked on many games and projects in my classes so far, and a good chunk of them are not currently available to the public, but a majority of the games that are can be found on my [itch.io page](https://jqual1.itch.io/) or the [DiscoTrayStudios itch.io page](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/).
Then there is also a fun game that I made in Java called Ono.
It is very similar to Uno, but bugs are features and you don't choose the color that it changes to.
[Here](https://github.com/Jqual1/Ono) is the code for that.
The code for many of the other projects I have worked on can be found on [my github](https://github.com/Jqual1/) as well.

In CSCI340 Databases and Web Systems my final project was a Solar Eclipse Party website.
This is one of the things not yet available to the public, but once it is I will be sure to include a link to that.

In the future I may include personal Art projects on this page or another page as well, but for now just know that I am working on art and writing in my spare time.

I hope to be a well-rounded person after Hendrix, and work on achieving that goal daily.
