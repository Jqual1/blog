I have worked on many games and projects in my classes so far, and a good chunk of them are not currently available to the public, but a majority of the games that are can be found on my [itch.io page](https://jqual1.itch.io/) or the [DiscoTrayStudios itch.io page](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/).
Then there is also a fun game that I made in Java called Ono.
It is very similar to Uno, but bugs are features and you don't choose the color that it changes to.
[Here](https://github.com/Jqual1/Ono) is the code for that.
The code for many of the other projects I have worked on can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Jqual1/) as well.
