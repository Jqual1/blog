This is the blog of a sophomore Computer Science major at Hendrix in *Disco Tray Studios*. **HDX '24**!!!
My goal is to become the best programmer that I can. I want to be able to apply my experience in as many
ways as possible. I have worked on many things so far and more info on that can be seen on the
[Projects](/blog/projects/) page.
